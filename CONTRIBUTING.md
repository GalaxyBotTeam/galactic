# Contributing

Welcome to the galactic project! We’re excited to have you join our open-source community. This guide will help you set up your development environment, adhere to our coding standards, and contribute effectively.

## Getting Started

To contribute to galactic, you should have a basic familiarity with:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) & [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) & [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Basic knowledge of clustering and sharding concepts for Discord bots is a plus

## Development Environment Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
4. Build the project using `npm run build` or `yarn build`
5. Run tests with `npm test` or `yarn test` (optional but encouraged)
6. Start developing your feature or fix on a dedicated branch

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the official TypeScript and ESLint extensions for the best developer experience.

## Making Contributions

- Always create a new branch for your changes. Avoid committing directly to `main`.
- Keep pull requests focused and manageable—one feature, fix, or improvement per pull request.
- Add clear commit messages and documentation for your changes.
- Open your pull request against the main galactic repository.
- If your work is ongoing, mark the pull request as a Draft.

***

## Code Review Process

All pull requests undergo review by the maintainers.  
After approval, your changes will be merged.

Depending on the size and complexity, reviews may take several days.
